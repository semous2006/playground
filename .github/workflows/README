# Node.js Testing and Publishing

This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow for testing and publishing a Node.js package to NPM.

## Workflow Description

The workflow consists of two jobs:

1. **Test**: This job runs on every push to the main branch. It sets up Node.js, installs dependencies, and runs tests using `npm test`.

2. **Publish**: This job runs after the test job completes successfully. It also sets up Node.js, installs dependencies, and publishes the package to NPM using `npm publish`. It requires a secret `NPM_AUTH_TOKEN` to authenticate with NPM.

3. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    ```

4. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

5. Run UI tests for Module 3:

    ```bash
    npm run test:module3
    ```

6. Run UI tests for Module 4:

    ```bash
    npm run test:module4
    ```

## Workflow

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration. The workflow runs UI tests for Module 3 and Module 4 in parallel on each push to the main branch.

## Usage

To use this workflow in your own project, follow these steps:

1. Copy the contents of `.github/workflows` directory to your project's `.github/workflows` directory.
2. Make sure you have the appropriate npm scripts set up in your `package.json` file for testing and publishing.
3. Set up the `NPM_AUTH_TOKEN` secret in your GitHub repository settings with a valid npm authentication token.
